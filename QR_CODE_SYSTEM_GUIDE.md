# 📱 QR Code System - ID Cards

## ✅ **STATUS: FULLY WORKING WITH REAL QR CODES**

The ID Cards feature now generates **real, scannable, unique QR codes** for every student!

---

## 🎯 **Key Features:**

### **1. Real QR Code Generation**
- ✅ **Unique per student** - Each student ID gets its own QR code
- ✅ **Never repeats** - Same student ID = same QR code (deterministic)
- ✅ **Scannable** - Works with any QR scanner app
- ✅ **Contains data** - Stores student information in QR
- ✅ **Professional** - Deep blue color matching school branding

### **2. QR Code Contents**
Each QR code contains:
```json
{
  "studentId": "DU-2025-001",
  "name": "Fatima Ahmed Ali",
  "class": "Grade 8A",
  "year": "2024-2025"
}
```

### **3. Student Photo Display**
- ✅ **Real photos** - If photoUrl provided, shows actual image
- ✅ **Initials fallback** - Shows student initials (e.g., "FA") if no photo
- ✅ **Professional design** - Deep blue colored initials
- ✅ **Border** - White border around photo area

---

## 🔲 **QR Code Features:**

### **Uniqueness:**
```
Student ID: DU-2025-001 → QR Code A (always the same)
Student ID: DU-2025-002 → QR Code B (always the same)
Student ID: DU-2025-003 → QR Code C (always the same)

✅ Each student ID generates the SAME unique QR code every time
✅ QR codes NEVER repeat across different students
✅ Deterministic generation (same input = same output)
```

### **Scanning:**
```
1. Open any QR scanner app (iPhone Camera, Android Camera, etc.)
2. Point at QR code on ID card
3. Scanner reads the code
4. Shows student information:
   - Student ID: DU-2025-001
   - Name: Fatima Ahmed Ali
   - Class: Grade 8A
   - Year: 2024-2025
```

## 🎨 **ID Card Design:**

### **Layout:**
```

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

### **QR Code Generation:**
```typescript
// Create unique data for each student
const qrData = JSON.stringify({
  studentId: student.studentId,    // DU-2025-001
  name: student.name,               // Fatima Ahmed Ali
  class: student.class,             // Grade 8A
  year: selectedAcademicYear        // 2024-2025
});

// Generate QR code
const qrCodeDataUrl = await QRCodeLib.toDataURL(qrData, {
  errorCorrectionLevel: 'M',       // Medium error correction
  margin: 1,                        // Small margin
  width: 80,                        // 80x80 pixels
  color: {
    dark: '#1e3a8a',               // Deep blue (school color)
    light: '#ffffff'                // White background
  }
});

// Draw QR code on ID card
ctx.drawImage(qrImg, 300, 70, 80, 80);
```

### **Uniqueness Guarantee:**
- Each student ID is unique (e.g., DU-2025-001, DU-2025-002)
- QR code generation is **deterministic** (same input = same output)
- Therefore: Each student gets a **unique** QR code
- QR codes **never repeat** between students
- Same student scanned twice = same data
