## 🎓 System Philosophy

This system is built on three core principles:

1. **Accountability**: Clear deadlines and approval workflow ensure marks are submitted responsibly
2. **Quality Control**: Admin approval prevents errors and ensures consistency
3. **Fairness**: Time restrictions prevent late entries and maintain academic integrity

The deadline system ensures marks are entered promptly while giving teachers reasonable time. The admin approval adds a quality gate before marks become official.
