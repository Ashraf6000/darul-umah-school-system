</div>
```
**Visible to:** Everyone (Admin + Teacher)

      <Camera className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      Upload Photo
    </Button>

    </p>
  </div>
)}

### 3. Profile Fields - Disabled for Teachers ✅

**Before:**

  id="name"
  value={profile.name}

/>
```

**After:**

  disabled={user.role === "teacher" || !isEditing}  // Always disabled for teachers
/>

- Teachers focus on teaching, not security

### Why Restrict Photo Upload to Admin?

#### 1. **Professional Standards**
- Admin ensures appropriate photos
- Maintains consistent photo quality
- Prevents inappropriate uploads
- Professional appearance

#### 2. **Data Management**
- Centralized photo management
- Consistent photo formats

## Teacher Password Management Workflow

### If Teacher Needs Password Change:
1. Teacher contacts administrator
2. Admin logs into system
3. Admin navigates to Teachers page
4. Admin edits teacher record
5. Admin updates password
6. Admin informs teacher of new password

### Benefits:
- ✅ Secure password management
- ✅ Admin control and oversight
- ✅ Audit trail
- ✅ Professional process

---

## Implementation Details

### Conditional Rendering
```jsx
// Photo upload
{user.role === "admin" && (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Button>Upload Photo</Button>
  </div>
)}

// Password change
{user.role === "admin" && (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>Change Password</CardHeader>
    <CardContent>...</CardContent>
  </Card>
)}
```

### User Role Check
- Uses `user.role` from AppContext
- Values: `"admin"` or `"teacher"`
- React automatically re-renders when role changes
- No additional state management needed

---

## What Teachers Still Have Access To

### Profile Information Card
- ✅ View avatar/photo (no upload)
- ✅ Edit full name
- ✅ Edit email address
- ✅ Edit phone number
- ✅ View employee ID (read-only)
- ✅ View subjects (read-only)
- ✅ Edit/Save buttons

### Teacher Can Update:
1. **Name** - If legally changed
2. **Email** - If email address changes
3. **Phone** - If phone number changes

### Teacher Cannot Update:
1. ❌ Profile photo
2. ❌ Password
3. ❌ Employee ID (system-assigned)
4. ❌ Subjects (admin-assigned)
