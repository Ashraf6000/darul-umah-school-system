# Academic Year-Based Data System

## 📅 How It Works

The Darul Umah School Management System now supports **year-specific data** with a global academic year selector.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Each academic year has its own separate dataset:**
- Students for 2024-2025
- Students for 2023-2024
- Students for 2022-2023
- Students for 2021-2022
- (and so on...)

**When you switch years, the data changes accordingly.**

---

## 🔄 Year Selector Location

**Top Navigation Header:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Darul Umah School  [📅 2024-2025 ▼]    Logout   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Visible on ALL dashboard pages
- ✅ Global selector affects entire system
- ✅ Persists across page navigation
- ✅ Saved in localStorage

## 🆔 Student ID Generation Per Year

**Format:** `DU-YEAR-NUMBER`

### **Examples by Year:**

**2024-2025:**
- First student: `DU-2025-001`
- Second student: `DU-2025-002`
- Third student: `DU-2025-003`

**2023-2024:**
- First student: `DU-2024-001`
- Second student: `DU-2024-002`

**2021-2022:**
- First student: `DU-2022-001`
- Second student: `DU-2022-002`

### **Key Points:**
✅ **Year-specific numbering** - Each year starts from 001  
✅ **Auto-increments** within each year  
✅ **No conflicts** between years  
✅ **Easy to identify** which year a student belongs to

### **How Data is Stored:**

```javascript

  "2024-2025": {
    students: [student1, student2, student3],
    marks: [mark1, mark2],
    attendance: [record1, record2]
  },
  "2023-2024": {
    students: [student4, student5],
    marks: [mark3],
