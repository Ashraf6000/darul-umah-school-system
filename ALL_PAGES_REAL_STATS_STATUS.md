# All Dashboard Pages - Real Statistics & Data Updates

## Summary
Comprehensive audit and update of all dashboard pages to replace fake/mock data with real calculations from localStorage and context. This includes academic year access control, subject selection improvements, bidirectional page connections, and removal of irrelevant student status fields.

---

## Session Updates Overview

### 1. Academic Year - Admin Only Access ✅
- Academic Year page restricted to admin users only
- Removed from teacher navigation menu
- Teachers redirected if attempting direct URL access
- Academic Year selector hidden from teachers
- All backend API endpoints require admin role

- Links to Subjects page for quick setup

### 3. Student Status Removed ✅
- Removed "active/inactive" status from students

### 4. Records & Reports Connection ✅
- Bidirectional links between Records and Reports pages
- Both pages use real data from localStorage
- Records exports actual student/teacher/results data
- Reports calculates real performance statistics
- Seamless workflow for data analysis and archival

### 5. Complete Archive Function Removed ✅
- Removed "Generate Complete Archive" button

**Key Calculations**:
```javascript
// Performance bands
excellentCount: studentAverages.filter(avg => avg >= 85).length
goodCount: studentAverages.filter(avg => avg >= 70 && avg < 85).length
satisfactoryCount: studentAverages.filter(avg => avg >= 50 && avg < 70).length
needsImprovementCount: studentAverages.filter(avg => avg < 50).length

// Marks stats
classAverage: allMarks.reduce((sum, mark) => sum + mark, 0) / allMarks.length
highestMark: Math.max(...allMarks)
lowestMark: Math.min(...allMarks)
passRate: (passed / allMarks.length) * 100
```
