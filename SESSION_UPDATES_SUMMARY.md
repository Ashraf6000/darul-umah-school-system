## 🚫 5. Student Status Removed

### What Changed
Removed the "active/inactive" status concept from student data.

### Rationale
- Students don't have login accounts
- No authentication for students or parents
- "Active/inactive" status is only relevant for employees (teachers)
- Status field was confusing and unused

### Files Modified
- `client/pages/dashboard/Records.tsx`

### Impact

#### Statistics Display
**Before:**
```
Total Students: 450
  445 active, 240 male, 210 female
```

**After:**
```
Total Students: 3
  2 male, 1 female
```

#### PDF Export
**Before:** 5 columns (ID, Name, Class, Gender, Status)
**After:** 4 columns (ID, Name, Class, Gender)

#### CSV Export
**Before:** 7 columns (ID, Name, Class, Gender, Status, Email, Phone)
**After:** 6 columns (ID, Name, Class, Gender, Email, Phone)

### Teacher Status Kept
Teachers still have status field because:
- ✅ Teachers have login accounts
- ✅ Employment status is relevant (active/terminated employees)
- ✅ Used for HR purposes

---

## ❌ 6. Complete Archive Function Removed

### What Was Removed
- "Complete Archive" purple card section
- `exportAllRecords()` function
- Archive Contents bullet list
- "Generate Complete Archive" button

### Why Removed
- Individual exports are more useful
- Users can export specific record types (students, teachers, results, attendance)
- Simpler interface
- More control over what data to export

### What Remains
Users can still export:
- ✅ Student records (PDF/Excel)

---

## 📚 9. My Classes - Simplified to Students Only

### What Changed
Simplified the My Classes page to focus only on viewing students. Removed Attendance and Enter Marks buttons from class cards.

### Files Modified

### What Was Removed
- ❌ "Attendance" button (was in 2-column grid)
- ❌ "Enter Marks" button (was full-width primary button)

### What Remains

### Rationale

**My Classes should focus on:**

```

## 🎓 Academic Year Access Control Details

### What Admins Can Do
- ✅ View Academic Year menu item
- ✅ Access Academic Year management page
- ✅ See academic year selector dropdown
- ✅ Create new academic years
- ✅ Edit existing academic years
- ✅ Delete academic years (if no students)
- ✅ Set current academic year
- ✅ Call all academic year API endpoints

### What Teachers Cannot Do
- ❌ See Academic Year menu item
- ❌ Access Academic Year page
- ❌ See academic year selector
- ❌ Make any academic year API calls
- ❌ Bypass protection via direct URL

### Backend Protection
All endpoints require `authMiddleware` + `adminOnly`:
```javascript
GET    /api/academic-years         // Admin only
GET    /api/academic-years/current // Admin only
POST   /api/academic-years         // Admin only
PUT    /api/academic-years/:id     // Admin only
DELETE /api/academic-years/:id     // Admin only
```

## 📈 Reports Page Calculations

### Performance Bands (Real-time)
```javascript
// Calculate average per student
studentAverages = results.map(r => {
  marks = r.subjects.map(s => s.mark);
  return marks.reduce(sum) / marks.length;
});

// Count by performance level
Excellent: avg >= 85
Good: 70 <= avg < 85
Satisfactory: 50 <= avg < 70
Needs Improvement: avg < 50
```

### Marks Statistics (Real-time)
```javascript
allMarks = results.flatMap(r => r.subjects.map(s => s.mark));

Class Average: sum(allMarks) / count(allMarks)
Highest Mark: Math.max(...allMarks)
Lowest Mark: Math.min(...allMarks)
Pass Rate: (marks >= 50) / total * 100
```
